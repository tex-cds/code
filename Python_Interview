# Assignment: Write a query that calculates the difference between the highest salaries found in the marketing and engineering departments. Output just the absolute difference in salaries.

import pandas as pd

salary_diff = 0

df = pd.merge(db_employee, db_dept, how='inner', left_on='department_id', right_on='id')

marketing_max_salary = df[df['department']=='marketing']['salary'].max()
engineering_max_salary = df[df['department']=='engineering']['salary'].max()

salary_diff = abs(marketing_max_salary - engineering_max_salary)

print(salary_diff)
