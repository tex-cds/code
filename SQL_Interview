-- Assignment 1: Find the email activity rank for each user. Email activity rank is defined by the total number of emails sent. The user with the highest number of emails sent will have a rank of 1, and so on. Output the user, total emails, and their activity rank. Order records by the total emails in descending order. Sort users with the same number of emails in alphabetical order.
--             In your rankings, return a unique value (i.e., a unique rank) even if multiple users have the same number of emails.

-- Create CTE to combine to_user and from_user fields, and to derive a count of all emails for all users
with total_emails AS(
SELECT from_user AS user, count(*) AS email_count
FROM google_gmail_emails
GROUP BY from_user
UNION
SELECT to_user AS user, count(*) AS email_count
FROM google_gmail_emails
GROUP BY to_user
)

SELECT *, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY email_count DESC, user ASC) AS ranking
FROM total_emails
